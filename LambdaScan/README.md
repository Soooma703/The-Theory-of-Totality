# Totality Field Theory: λ Determination by Energy Stability

This repository contains code to reproduce **Appendix A: Determination of the Self-Interaction Coefficient λ** of the Totality Field Theory (TFT) paper.

We scan a wide range of candidate values of λ to find the unique value that minimizes long-term energy fluctuation of the nonlinear existential field Ψ(X,Φ), following:

    δE = max(E[Ψ(Φ)]) - min(E[Ψ(Φ)])

## 🧪 What it Does

1. Simulates the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation:

       ∂²Ψ/∂Φ² - c² ∂²Ψ/∂X² + λ Ψ³ = 0

2. Calculates total energy at each time step:

       E[Ψ] = ∫ [ (1/2)(∂Ψ/∂Φ)² + (1/2)c²(∂Ψ/∂X)² + (1/4)λΨ⁴ ] dX

3. Selects λ minimizing energy fluctuation.

This reproduces the theoretical procedure of the TFT paper (Appendix A).

### High-Resolution Scan (λ ∈ [0.060, 0.100], Δλ = 0.0001)

This script performs a high-precision numerical scan around the theoretically predicted value λ = 0.0860 to verify its stability.  
The global minimum is confirmed at λ = 0.08630, validating the theoretical selection made in the main simulation.

This script is not used for fitting λ, but rather for confirming its uniqueness under energy conservation criteria.
