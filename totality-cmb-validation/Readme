# Totality Field Theory - CMB High-ℓ Validation

This repository contains the official implementation of the results reported in:

**Section 5.1: Empirical Validation I: CMB High-$\ell$ Structure**  
from the Totality Field Theory paper.

It compares the ΛCDM model with the Totality model using Planck 2018 CMB TT power spectrum data, employing harmonic modulations and information-theoretic model comparison (χ², AIC, BIC, p-value).
