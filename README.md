# Totality Field Theory Simulations and Analysis

This repository contains simulation scripts and analysis tools for exploring structure formation in the nonlinear existence field Ψ(X, Φ), as proposed in Totality Field Theory (TFT).

## 🌀 Totality Field Dimensional Simulations (`1D.py`–`5D.py`)

Simulates nonlinear wave evolution in 1D〜5D to examine dimensional dependence of stable structure formation.

- Random wave initialization
- Interference peak tracking
- Fractal analysis
- Histogram outputs (volume, energy)

**Purpose**: Identify which dimensions allow self-sustaining particle-like formations.

---

## 📉 λ Stability Scanner (`lambda_calcurate.py`)

Scans a range of λ values to determine at which point stable interference structures begin to appear.

- Evolves Ψ for each λ
- Tracks internal energy fluctuation (δE)
- Finds minimum δE as stability threshold

**Purpose**: Estimate critical λ ≈ 0.57 where stability emerges.

---

## 🧠 Detailed 3D Analysis (`detailed_analysis.py`)

Runs a high-resolution 3D simulation at λ = 0.57 and performs detailed structure analysis.

- Detects all interference peaks
- Measures structure volume, amplitude, energy
- Computes spatial distance between structures
- Tracks largest structure trajectory

**Purpose**: Quantify and visualize structure properties in 3D where TFT predicts maximal stability.
