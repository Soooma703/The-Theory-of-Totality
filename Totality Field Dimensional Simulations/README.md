# Totality Field Dimensional Simulations

This repository contains numerical simulations of nonlinear wave dynamics across 1D to 5D spatial domains, developed within the framework of the **Totality Field Theory (TFT)**. These simulations aim to explore how stable structures — analogous to particles — can spontaneously emerge from interference patterns in a fundamental existence field, denoted as $\Psi(X, \Phi)$.

## 🔬 Purpose

The primary objective is to investigate **dimensional dependence of structure formation** in nonlinear existence fields governed by a generalized wave equation:

∂²Ψ/∂Φ² - c² ∇²Ψ + λ Ψ³ = 0

This system mimics core principles of TFT, where **space, time, matter, and even consciousness** are emergent from the evolving interference topology of the field $\Psi$.

## 🧠 Files Overview

Each script corresponds to a simulation in different spatial dimensions. They share a common structure:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1D.py` | Simulates and analyzes interference structures in 1 spatial dimension. Includes fractal analysis of localized peaks. |
| `2D.py` | Extends the model to 2D grids, generating 2D structure maps and energy histograms. |
| `3D.py` | Simulates volumetric (voxel-based) structure formation. Outputs fractal estimates and energy distributions. |
| `4D.py` | Simulates 4D field evolution with projection analysis. Computationally intensive. |
| `5D.py` | Explores the breakdown of coherent structure formation in 5D — useful for testing dimensional stability in TFT. |

## 📈 Features

- **Spontaneous Structure Emergence**: From random Gaussian initial fields, stable localized peaks emerge without external forcing.
- **Peak Tracking**: Counts and records number of coherent peaks per timestep.
- **Structure Analysis**:
  - Volume (cell count)
  - Energy (integrated amplitude squared)
  - Fractal dimension estimate D_f = log(V) / log(BoxSize)
- **Visualization**: Automatically generates histograms of structure distributions.

## ⚙️ How to Run

Each script is standalone and can be run with Python 3.8+:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy tqdm
python 3D.py
```
## 📊 Output

Each simulation run will:

1. Simulate 500 timesteps of nonlinear field evolution governed by:
∂²Ψ/∂Φ² - c² ∇²Ψ + λ Ψ³ = 0
2. Track and record the number of interference peaks (local maxima) at each timestep.
3. Analyze the final timestep snapshot to extract:
   - **Total structure count** (disconnected regions with amplitude above threshold)
   - **Volume distribution** of each structure (in voxel units)
   - **Energy distribution** (sum of $\Psi^2$ per structure)
   - **Fractal dimension estimate**:
     \[
     D_f = \frac{\log(V)}{\log(\text{BoxSize})}
     \]
4. Generate and save visualizations:
   - Histogram of structure volumes
   - Histogram of structure energies
   - Fractal dimension distribution
   - Files saved as `D*.png` (e.g., `D3_volume_hist.png`)

## 🧭 Interpretation within TFT

According to **Totality Field Theory (TFT)**, persistent interference nodes are interpreted as **proto-particles** — localized, stable excitations of the existence field $\Psi(X, \Phi)$. These simulations aim to demonstrate that:

- **Dimensional stability**: Stable particle-like structures emerge **only in specific dimensions**, notably 3D.
- **Higher-dimensional suppression**: In 4D and 5D simulations, coherence breaks down, suggesting a natural limit to matter stability.
- **Quantum correspondence**: These emergent structures provide a possible ontological basis for the discreteness and localization seen in quantum particles — arising not from external fields, but from **internal self-organization** of $\Psi$.
